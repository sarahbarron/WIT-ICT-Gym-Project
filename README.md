### College: Waterford Institute of Technology
### Course: HDip Computer Science
### Subject: ICT
### Project: final project - Gym App
===========================================================================================================================================

This is a Gym App that allows gym members sign up, login and view their analytics (BMI, BMI Category & Ideal Weight Indicator), Assessments (weight, waist, chest, thigh, upper arms and hip measurements), Goals (weight and waist measurement goals and status if the goal was achieved, missed or still open). A member can add and delete assessments and goals.
The Gym App also allows trainers login and view all the members and members details. The trainer can add and delete goals, add comments to assessments and delete members.

#### I used the following technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JavaScript templating engine Handlebars
* NodeJS
* JSON
* lowdb (Small JSON database for Node and the browser.)
